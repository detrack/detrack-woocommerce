Never lose track of your WooCommerce Orders with Detrack Proof of Delivery. Let your customers track your deliveries live and rest assured with automatic Proof of Deliveries.

== Description ==

Detrack is a Proof of Delivery and a Live Delivery Tracking solution for both E-Commerce stores and brick-and-mortar stores. This plugin allows you to integrate your WooCommerce storefront with your Detrack Dashboard.

For you to use this plugin, you must have already set up a free account on [Detrack](https://www.detrack.com) and understand the basic functions of our Dashboard.
If you are a completely new user, please look at the [quick tour](https://www.detrack.com/tour) of our features and the [quick start guide](https://www.detrack.com/quick-start-guide).

Once installed and properly configured, new orders on your WooCommerce store will automatically be sent to your Detrack Dashboard for you to dispatch jobs to your drivers.
While the default settings only send the shipping address and your customer's name to the Dashboard, you can configure the settings to have more information appear in your dashboard.
