Real-time tracking and electronic proof of delivery solution that allows you and your customers to track their orders and have full visibility of the entire delivery process.

== Description ==

Want vital delivery information of all your orders at your fingertips?

Why not allow your customers to track their WooCommerce orders themselves?

Detrack is a real-time vehicle tracking and proof of delivery solution that provides both you and your customers the ability to track their orders and have full visibility of the entire delivery process.

Knowing exactly where your orders are at any time will now allow you to answer customers’ queries or resolve delivery issues both efficiently and confidently.

The Detrack plugin allows you to seamlessly integrate your WooCommerce store with your Detrack dashboard.

To use the plugin, simply set up a [free Detrack account](https://app.detrack.com/sign_up).

Once the plugin is successfully installed and configured, new orders on your WooCommerce store will automatically be sent to your Detrack dashboard to start facilitating deliveries.

By default, only the Delivery Address and Customer Name will be reflected on your Detrack dashboard, but you can easily opt for more information to appear by selecting the necessary options in the settings.
